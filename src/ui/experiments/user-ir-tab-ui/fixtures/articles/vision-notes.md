# Vision-first capture

A short markdown note that references a screenshot of an error panel. The screenshot should survive the degrade ladder when capability = vision, and be flagged when forced to text-only.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Capture screenshot of the error panel
2. Record markdown highlights
3. Inspect the envelope to see how the image is ordered next to the text

# App extraction snippets

- Dashboard tiles: occupancy, live trend, forecast
- Inline filters: building, floor, desk block
- Export actions: CSV, clipboard, or send-to-tab
- Context IR call shows truncated labels when the budget shrinks

These snippets intentionally read like UI copy. They should be scored lower than the long article but still show up with headers when the budget is tight.
